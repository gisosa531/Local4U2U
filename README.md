## User Story

```md
AS A Local Vendor who wants to sell various items virtually,
I WANT to be able to showcase available items to be sold to anyone looking to buy locally items such as produce, Accessories, Clothing or Food
SO THAT my local company can be recognized by the community to maximize my client base
```

## Background

- As a Vendor I want to be able to display my local products on a website that clients can purchase which will show them an image, price, and stock quantity.
- As a client interested in local products, they can login (new or existing) to produce all available vendor products.
