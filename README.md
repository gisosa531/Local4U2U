# Project-2: Local4U2U

## Description
- In 2020, COVID-19 shutdown the entire world down leaving limited access to resources people needed for daily living. Corporate wholesale stores such as WalMart, Costco and the like had their deliveries put to a halt leaving everyone to rely on what they had at home without the thought of being able to replenish them anytime soon. As the world heavily relies on Corporate stores for resources, it is important more now than ever that we support the community that we live in.  
- Love Local Shop Local
