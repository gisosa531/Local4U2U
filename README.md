# Project-2: Local4U2U

## User Story
- In 2020, COVID-19 shutdown the entire world leaving limited access to resources people needed for daily living. Corporate wholesale stores such as WalMart, Costco and the like had their deliveries put to a halt leaving everyone to rely on what they had without the thought of being able to replenish needed resources. 
As the world heavily relies on Corporate stores for resources, it is important more now than ever that we support the community that we live in.  
- With this in mind we can achieve this...
